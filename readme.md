# QR Code Generator

Simple example to generate QR codes in CFML using the zxing java library. It is only tested with Coldfusion 11, but it should work on other CFML engines.

## Getting Started

Download this project into your Coldfusion webroot and point your browser to the /qrcode-in-cfml/index.cfm.
It should display a PDF document in the browser. The URL in the QR code is pointing back here.
